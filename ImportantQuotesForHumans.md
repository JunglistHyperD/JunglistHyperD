**"I can either do it quickly, or I can do it properly"** - Stuart Reeves 

**"Culture eats strategy for breakfast”** - Peter Drucker

**"Whether you think you can or you can't, you're probably right.** - Henry Ford

**"Real improvement only can take place when there is a front-line focus based on direct observation of current conditions where work is done.”** - John Shook : Managing to Learn

## Note from [Poor Charlies Almanack](https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Poor-Charlies-Almanack-Audiobook/B0CMDCJN99) on the professions:

All professions would greatly benefit from a Six Element system similar to a ~~pilot's~~ hacker's training:
- Training covers everything which would be applicable to the ~~piloting~~ hacking not just a subset of common things
- Knowledge and training is to reach practice based fluency and handle 2/3 intertwined hazards at once; not just to pass one or two exams.
- Ability to think forward and in reverse:
  - Forward: based to these inputs/constraints, we can get to the outcome X
  - Backward: based on situation X we currently see, we most likely got there based on these inputs/constraints
- Trained so that what is most important gets the most training coverage and so gets raised to the highest fluency levels
- Checklist routines at mandatory
- Should be forced into a special knowledge maintenance routine to prevent skills atrophy from long disuse of skills used to cope in rare and important problems.

## Theodore Roosevelt said ....

```
"It is not the critic who counts; 
not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, 
or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, 
whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; 
who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, 
because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; 
but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; 
who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, 
and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly,

so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat."
```
